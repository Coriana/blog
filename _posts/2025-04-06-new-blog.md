## Why this blog?

Honestly, its hosted in such a way all I have to do is write my ideas down and publish, these become essentially static pages, and I don't have to stress about many things.

I will be using AI to transcribe my ideas from verbal to text, and then cleaning up as otherwise my quest for perfection will mean I will go back to never publishing anything until ready, which nothing ever is.

This post is mostly to test deployment and seeing if everything updates okay.

## Lessons learnt.

Timezones suck, as always, I took the page breaking when I added content to be something template related that broke, but no, apparently servers are smart and time can't be in the future.

Even if its for text, fortunately, 
```
future: true # Build posts dated in the future
```
works for allowing this, and setting the local timezone, and removing the offset is actually easier.

Hopefully deployment issues are now over, and the fun can begin.
