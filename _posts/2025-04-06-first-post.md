This is my first blog post! I've set up this Jekyll-based blog to share my thoughts and experiences. This was accomplished using ChatGPT and VS Code's new Agent feature. 

## Features of this blog

- Simple and clean design
- Markdown support for easy writing
- Responsive layout that works on mobile devices
- Automatically generated navigation
- Built and hosted with GitHub Pages

Try out some markdown features like [links](https://github.com/Coriana/coriana.github.io), **bold text**, and even code blocks:

```python
print("Hello, Blog!")
```
